# Privacy-Preserving-Localization-and-Privileged-Sensor-Fusion-in-a-Camera-Network
This project involves designing a small-scale camera network using Raspberry Pi nodes to track a moving object. Each node will process the camera data to detect and track the object. The aggregation of the nodesâ€™ data will rely on two cryptographically secure methods to ensure the privacy of some or all of the input data. The first algorithm relies on a privacy preserving aggregation scheme, while the second distinguishes between privileged and unprivileged participants, allowing quantifiable partial leakage of sensor information.
